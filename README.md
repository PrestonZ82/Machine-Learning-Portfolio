# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
This portfolio will be used for CS 4375

## Overview of Machine Learning
This pdf is my point of view of machine learning. 

You can see the pdf [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration in C++
The purpose of this assignment is to create our own functions to find statistical data from two vectors using C++.
Also, to compare the getting data from a set in R and C++. Lastly, a write up about the entire assigment including thoughts on R and C++ and the meaning
of these statiscal values and how they can be used.

You can see the pdf [here](Data_Exploration_Output_and_Write_Up.pdf).
You can see the code [here](Data_Exploration.cpp).

## Using linear models in R
I found large data sets on the internet. Took them in, performed minor data cleaning. The created three linear regression models. Then I took in another data set
performed same cleaning. Then built a logistic regression model and a naive bayes model. Then discussed in depth the process and information of these models.

You can see the Linear regression code [here](Regression.Rmd)
You can see the pdf for the linear code [here](Regression.nb.html)
