# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
This portfolio will be used for CS 4375

## Overview of Machine Learning
This pdf is my point of view of machine learning. 

You can see the pdf [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration in C++
The purpose of this assignment is to create our own functions to find statistical data from two vectors using C++.
Also, to compare the getting data from a set in R and C++. Lastly, a write up about the entire assigment including thoughts on R and C++ and the meaning
of these statiscal values and how they can be used.

You can see the pdf [here](Data_Exploration_Output_and_Write_Up.pdf).
You can see the code [here](Data_Exploration.cpp).

## Using linear models in R
I found large data sets on the internet. Took them in, performed minor data cleaning. The created three linear regression models. Then I took in another data set
performed same cleaning. Then built a logistic regression model and a naive bayes model. Then discussed in depth the process and information of these models.

You can see the Linear regression code [here](Regression.Rmd)
You can see the pdf for the linear code [here](Regression.nb.html)
You can see the Logistic and Bayes code [here](Classification.Rmd)
For some reason the PDF for Logistic and Bayes will not update. I am not sure what the problem is. If you look at the source
code it is different than what the pdf prints out.

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch
A partner and I constructed a logistic regression model and a Naive Bayes model from scratch in C++. My partner did the logistic regression and I did the Naive Bayes model.
You can see our writeout about the algorithms [here](ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf)
You can see the logistic regression code [here](Logistic_Regression.cpp)
You can see the Naive Bayes model code [here](NaibeBayesFromScratch.cpp)

## Similarity and Ensemlbe
A group of 5 us completed multiple machine learning objectives.

The first person completed linear regression, knn regression, and decision tree regression. You can see their work [here](Similarity.pdf)
The second person completed logisitc regression, knn regression, and decision tree regression for a classification data set. You can see their work [here](AVinluan_Program4Part2.pdf)
The third person completed kmeans clustering, heirarchical clustering, and model based clustering. You can see their work [here](Clustering.pdf)
The fourth person completed PCA and LDA on a data set. You can see their work [here](Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)
The fifth person(me) managed the project and wrote a report on kNN, decision trees, clustering methods, PCA, LDA for both classification and regression when applicable. You can see my work [here](ML_Narrative_Document.pdf)
## sklearn in Python
Used sklearn in python to try and read in a data set and do logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network. I had trouble completing some of it. You can view the notebook [here](notebook.pdf)

## Image Classification
This assigment was to take an image dataset from kaggle and perform multiple image classifcaiton models on it. I attempted to do a sequtinal model, then include CNN and RNN in seperate tests. Lastly, I tried using a pretrained model. I used the intel image classficaitoon model from Kaggle. You can find the notebook [here](ImageClassification.ipynb) and you can find the analysis [here](MachineLearningImageClassificationAnalysis.pdf)
