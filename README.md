# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
This portfolio will be used for CS 4375

## Overview of Machine Learning
This pdf is my point of view on machine learning. 

You can see the pdf [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration in C++
The purpose of this assignment is to create our own functions to find statistical data from two vectors using C++.
Also, to compare the getting data from a set in R and C++. Lastly, a write up about the entire assignment including thoughts on R and C++ and the meaning
of these statistical values and how they can be used.

You can see the pdf [here](Data_Exploration_Output_and_Write_Up.pdf).
You can see the code [here](Data_Exploration.cpp).

## Using linear models in R
I found large data sets on the internet. Took them in, performed minor data cleaning. Then created three linear regression models. Then I took in another data set
performed the same cleaning. Then built a logistic regression model and a naive bayes model. Then discussed in depth the process and information of these models.

You can see the Linear regression code [here](Regression.Rmd)
You can see the pdf for the linear code [here](Regression.nb.html)
You can see the Logistic and Bayes code [here](Classification.Rmd)
For some reason the PDF for Logistic and Bayes will not update. I am not sure what the problem is. If you look at the source
code it is different from what the pdf prints out.

## C++ Algorithms from Scratch
A partner and I constructed a logistic regression model and a Naive Bayes model from scratch in C++. My partner did the logistic regression and I did the Naive Bayes model.
You can see our write out about the algorithms [here](ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf)
You can see the logistic regression code [here](Logistic_Regression.cpp)
You can see the Naive Bayes model code [here](NaibeBayesFromScratch.cpp)

## Similarity and Ensemble
A group of 5 us completed multiple machine learning objectives.

The first person completed linear regression, knn regression, and decision tree regression. You can see their work [here](Similarity.pdf)
The second person completed logistic regression, knn regression, and decision tree regression for a classification data set. You can see their work [here](AVinluan_Program4Part2.pdf)
The third person completed kmeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and model based clustering. You can see their work [here](Clustering.pdf)
The fourth person completed PCA and LDA on a data set. You can see their work [here](Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)
The fifth person(me) managed the project and wrote a report on kNN, decision trees, clustering methods, PCA, LDA for both classification and regression when applicable. You can see my work [here](ML_Narrative_Document.pdf)
## sklearn in Python
Used sklearn in python to try and read in a data set and do logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network. I had trouble completing some of it. You can view the notebook [here](notebook.pdf)

## Image Classification
This assignment was to take an image dataset from kaggle and perform multiple image classificaiton models on it. I attempted to do a sequential model, then include CNN and RNN in separate tests. Lastly, I tried using a pretrained model. I used the intel image classificaiton model from Kaggle. You can find the notebook [here](ImageClassification.ipynb) and you can find the analysis [here](MachineLearningImageClassificationAnalysis.pdf)

## Wrapping Up The Portfolio
Add a summary paragraph to the index page that reflects your skills in ML, enthusiasm for ML,
plans for future personal projects, plans for keeping up with this rapidly changing field, and
interest in possible employment opportunities. 

Over the course of this semester I gained a lot of knowledge on machine learning and how to implement machine learning models. I have an understanding of many machine learning models and techniques such as linear regression, knn regression, CNN, and Naive Bayes Models. I am still very interested in ML, even though I spent an entire semester learning about it. There is still so much more to learn about. I currently don't have any plans for new personal projects, but I do plan on revisiting a lot of the projects in this portfolio and improving upon them. I plan to keep reading about updates in machine learning and AI in order to try to keep up with this fast paced environment. I will be graduating in August, therefore I have been and will continue to apply for as many ML jobs as possible.
